<h1>Cendas</h1>
<p>cendas is a new pandas-based library optimized for analyzing data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. government agencies.
  The word "cendas" is a portmanteau of the words "census" and "pandas." I was motivated to develop this python library from my experiences
  doing research at the Internet Real-Time Lab at Columbia University under the supervsion of Prof. Henning Schulzrinne. Throughout the course
  of my research, I worked a lot with broadband adoption data provided by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and demographics data
  provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. I oftentimes found myself using the same blocks of code over and over again on these datasets. As a result,
  I thought it would be a good idea to put some of this code I used into a python package for the purposes of increasing workflow efficiency.
  I also figured I probably wasn't the only one who would find this useful. </p>
